# Cut-Up-Machine
In this project the idea of human interaction in creative writing will be challenge, by applying the cut-up technique presented by Surrealist writers (Andre Breton, Tristan Tzara, Guillaume Apollinaire, etc) to a source text. And generating a new piece of literature. The cut-up method in its purest form involve random manipulation of source text(s). The aim of this project is to implement a system which given one (or more) input texts, generates a new text using cut-up.

Four cut-up algorithms were built. Cut-up by words, it divides the text into words and then shuffles the words. Cut-up by sentences, divides the text into sentences and then shuffles the sentences. Cut-up by words with paragraphs, divides the text into words and then shuffles the words but also keeps a paragraph structure. Cut-up by paragraphs, divides the text into paragraphs and then shuffles the paragraphs.
A user interface was built for users to access these algorithms.

In this project the use of JavaScript is further explored, in conjunction with functionality and design.
