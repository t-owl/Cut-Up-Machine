And so the car plunged in the singing green
Of sycamore and riot-running chestnut and oak
That squandered flame, cut a thousand arteries and bled
Flood after summer flood,

But the thin tuning-fork of one of the needs of men,
The squat village letter-box, approached, awoke,
Called all to order with its stump of red;

So, shaking hands with the grim
Satisfactory argument,
The consolation of bone
Resigned to the event

For parting, a point in time,
Cannot have magnitude
And cannot cast shadows about
The final [kiss]
