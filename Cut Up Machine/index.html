                  In an attempt to minimize the influence of conscious control on creativity, 
                  Surrealist writers (Andre Breton, Tristan Tzara, Guillaume Apollinaire etc) 
                  investigated the technique now known as decoupe (or "cut up") in order to 
                  generate literary works. The same approach was later adopted by the American
                  writer William Burroughs who (with Brion Gysin) went on to explore the 
                  related "fold-in" approach to automatism. These approaches are especially 
                  well suited to poetry

                  In this project the idea of human interaction in creative writing will
                  be challenge, by applying the decoupe technique to a source text. And
                  generating a new piece of literature.<br/><br/>
